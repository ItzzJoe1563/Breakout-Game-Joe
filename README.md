# Breakout-Game-Joe
This is my Breakout game project, made as part of my application to google for a software engineering apprenticeship 

This game was made in Unity engine

Known Bugs
1) Sometimes the ball would become stuck in a horizontal plain on motion
2) On certain screens, the UI may not 'fill' properly, however the game should still be playable. This can be fixed by setting the resolution to (1024x768)

Features implmented 
1)The game contain a single screen, with 3 rows of bricks (not 8) for the purpose of the demo, however I have coded it in a way such that new bricks/rows can be easily added.
2)If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, you lose a life
3)After 5 lives, the game is over (you lose)
4)Every time the ball touches a brick, the brick dissapears and your score is increased.
5)If all the bricks are destroyed, the game ends (you win)
6)The ball bounces of the paddle, bricks, and left,top and right edges of the screen.
7)After the game ends, you can click play again to restart the game
8)I have also included an Alien which travels from left to right, adding a challenging element to the game
9) The Alien can be easily toggled on and off.
